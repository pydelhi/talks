# Here are some tips of engagement or giving a good talk.

#### 1. Use the stage to your advantage 
Keep walking, turning and looking
audience in the face - select a few people randomly for this. This will
force audience to follow you around and reduces boredom.

Use the full stage for your talk. Dont just stand at one place. Standing
just on the podium is the wog to do.

#### 2. Don't speak in a monotonous voice
Try to vary your voice to suit the
phases of the talk. Dont make it sound like a boring lecture at the same
pitch and tone. It tends to put people off and in worst case to sleep.
Use variations of pitch and tone to your advantage.

#### 3. Come to the core of the topic in first 10 minutes
Dont use elaborate 10 min + introductions. People dont have that kind of patience
these days. Dont forget that your talk is judged in first 10-15 mins in
this age of twitter.

#### 4. Keep the session interactive
Structure the presentation so you give
interaction options in between the talk rather than at the very end.
This puts audience on their toes and makes it more interesting.
Keep it as a conversation (dialogue) than a monologue.

#### 5. Add a touch of humour
I have often found this is one of the best
ways to engage the audience - to add a light touch of humor where it
fits. Everyone reacts to a good laugh.

#### 6. Make the presentation interesting
Pictures speak more than a 1000words. Slides with just text are *BORING*. Use graphics/video to good
effect. Theme your presentation. Also reduce the amount of text per
slide - not more than 4-5 lines at worst case.

#### 7. Give real life analogies
Wherever possible, try to give real life analogies rather than pedantic examples.
